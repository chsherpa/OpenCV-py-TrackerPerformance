# OpenCV-py-TrackerPerformance
Student Project for using Python Tracker with performance metrics projected alongside the target tracker

# Dependencies:
OpenCV : Instruction for installation for the Fedora can be found on docs.opencv.org/trunk/dd/dd5/tutorial_py_setup_in_fedora.html

For Fedora, it is much easier to install OpenCV using the dnf package manager than going out and compiling from source.
It is more likely than not that there'll be a missing package.

Necessary Packages available via DNF:
opencv.x86_64
pygtk2-devel
python2-numpy
python3-numpy
webkitgtk
gtk2
glibc
python2-dlib
python3-dlib
dlib

Necessary Packages available PIP:
sudo pip2 install imutils
sudo pip3 install imutils


Optional Packages available via DNF:
cmake build-essential pkg-config libgtk2.0-dev libtbb-dev python-dev python-numpy
python-scipy libjasper-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev
libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libdc1394-22-dev libv4l-dev
